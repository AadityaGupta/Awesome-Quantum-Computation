###What is Quantum Computation?

###Quantum Algorithms
- [Shor's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm): A factoring algorithm invented by Peter Shor in 1994
- [Grover's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm):  finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value
- [Hidden subgroup problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem)
- Boson sampling problem
- Estimating Gauss Sums
- Quantum Counting
- [Element Distinctness Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem)
- [Triangle Folding Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_finding_problem)
- Group commutativity
- Computing knot invariants
- [Quantum Sorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_sort): Mostly a waste to study because quantum computers can only sort at best in O(n log n) time. However, their space complexity is unmatched
