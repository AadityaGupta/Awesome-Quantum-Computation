###What is Quantum Computation?
Quantum computers are different from digital computers based on transistors. Whereas digital computers require data to be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits (qubits), which can be in superpositions of states. Quantum computing was the brainchild of the late and great physicist Richard Feynmean in the early 1980's, but only has materialized into a physical machine as of 2014 by D-Wave Systems. Hopefully we can continue to make great strides in this revolutionary industry so that we may tackle computing problems that were once deemed impossible!

###Quantum Algorithms
- [Shor's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm): A factoring algorithm invented by Peter Shor in 1994
- [Grover's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm):  finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value
- [Hidden subgroup problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem)
- Boson sampling problem
- Estimating Gauss Sums
- Quantum Counting
- [Element Distinctness Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem)
- [Triangle Folding Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_finding_problem)
- Group commutativity
- Computing knot invariants
- [Quantum Sorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_sort): Mostly a waste to study because quantum computers can only sort at best in O(n log n) time. However, their space complexity is unmatched
